            <div class="one">
                <h2>Tell Me About Yourself</h2>
                <p> This is one of the first questions you are likely to be asked. Be prepared to talk about yourself, and why you're an ideal candidate for the position. The interviewer wants to know why you're an excellent fit for the job.

                Try to answer questions about yourself without giving too much, or too little, personal information. You can start by sharing some of your personal interests and experiences that don't relate directly to work, such as a favorite hobby or a brief account of where you grew up, your education, and what motivates you.</p>
            </div>

   
            <div class="two">
                <h2>Why Are You the Best Person for the Job?</h2>
                <p>Are you the best candidate for the job? The hiring manager wants to know whether you have all the required qualifications. Be prepared to explain why you're the applicant who should be hired. 

                Make your response a confident, concise, focused sales pitch that explains what you have to offer and why you should get the job. This is a good time to review the qualifications and the requirements in the job listing, so you can craft a response that aligns with what the interviewer is looking for. </p>
            </div>

 
            <div class="one">
                <h2>Why Do You Want This Job?</h2>
                <p>Why are you a good fit for the position? What would you accomplish if you were hired? This interview question gives you an opportunity to show the interviewer what you know about the job and the company, so take time beforehand to thoroughly research the company, its products, services, culture, and mission.</p>
            </div>


             <div class="two">
                <h2>How Has Your Experience Prepared You for This Role?</h2>
                <p>Hiring managers use this question to learn how your previous work experience and educational background fit the job. To prepare to respond, make a list of the most relevant qualifications you have and match them to the requirements listed in the job description.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="one">
                <h2>Why Are You Leaving (or Have Left) Your Job?</h2>
                <p>Be prepared with a response to this question. You'll need to give an answer that’s honest and reflects your specific circumstances but keeps it positive. Even if you quit under challenging circumstances, now isn't the best time to share what could be construed as too much information with the interviewer.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="two">
                <h2>What Is Your Greatest Strength?</h2>
                <p>This is one of the questions that employers almost always ask to determine how well you are qualified for the position. When you are asked about your greatest strengths, it's important to discuss the attributes that qualify you for that specific job, and that will set you apart from other candidates.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="one">
                <h2>What Is Your Greatest Weakness?</h2>
                <p>Another typical question that interviewers will ask is about your weaknesses. Do your best to frame your answers around positive aspects of your skills and abilities as an employee, turning seeming “weaknesses” into strengths.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="two">
                <h2> How Do You Handle Stress and Pressure?</h2>
                <p>What do you do when things don’t go smoothly at work? How do you deal with difficult situations? The employer wants to know how you handle workplace stress.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="one">
                <h2>What Are Your Salary Expectations?</h2>
                <p>What are you looking for in terms of salary? Questions about money are always tricky to answer. You don't want to sell yourself short or price yourself out of a job offer. In some locations, employers are legally prohibited from asking you about salary history—but they can ask how much you expect to get paid.</p>
            </div>


            <div class="two">
                <h2>What Are Goals for the Future?</h2>
                <p>Are you a job hopper? Or do you plan on staying with the company, at least for a while? Where do you envision your career going? Do your plans for the future match the career path for someone typically hired for this position?</p>
